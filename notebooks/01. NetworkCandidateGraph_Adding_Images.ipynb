    "The ImageAdder object is a job dispatcher that has two primary access methods: `add_image` and `add_images`.  The former adds a single image to the database and the latter accepts both a directory and a file extension.  All files with the extension in said directory will be added to the database.  The process of adding an image includes the extraction of interest points (features), serialization of the interest points to disk in the same location as the image (saved as a .h5 file), generation of a camera model, computation of the image footprint, and addition of this information to the database.\n",

This allows the NAC objects to manage the database connection and not swamp the database with hundreds of concurrent connections.\n",
